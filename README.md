## Canvas API Game + Animation
A simple canvas-based game with dynamic color-changing effects, including the canvas border.

## Description
This project is a basic canvas game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It demonstrates the use of the HTML canvas element and basic animation techniques to create an interactive visual effect where colors change dynamically as they hit the edges of the canvas. 
Additionally, the border of the canvas changes color to complement the changing colors of the shapes.

## Features
- Dynamic color effects: Colors change randomly when edges are hit.
- Border color change: The canvas border changes color to complement the changing colors of the shapes.
- Simple and lightweight: Built using vanilla JavaScript and minimal dependencies.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
